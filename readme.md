we'll create RESTful Api's:
    1. to handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
    2. connect/create/delete a user
    3. it'll allow users to signup/signin (which will give them a token to use for authentication)
    4. a signed-up user can create a check 
    5. a signed-in user can edit/delete any of his checks
- integrate sms alert feature (we'll use twilio) for this, when a user creates a check, he is alerted via sms
- signup and signin features
- we'll use mongodb not file system
